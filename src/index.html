    <h1>A/C System Troubleshooting - 2010 Honda Odyssey</h1>

    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>
        Our 2010 Honda Odyssey's AC system doesn't appear to be working hardly at all. It seems like it was a gradual decline. Last year it didn't work the best either but not like this. About a couple months ago I did try to recharge from a can, but it didn't seem to have any effect. I think I might've put in about 10 ounces of refrigerant,
        but I'm not really sure how much I put in. It was one of those cans you get from Walmart that comes with the gauge and just put it on the low side and fill until the the gauge reads well enough. Instead of spending the money to repair, I would like to tackle this myself. But now I'm at a point where I would like guidance and I don't want to just willy-nilly replace parts. I would like to understand what's happening here, and how to read the pressures and tempering that I'm getting. I can see that the compressor clutch is absolutely engaging by the way. That is not the issue. I would like to know how to proceed next, or how to diagnose from the readings I took. I tried to be thorough and complete.
    </p>

    <h2>Initial Pressure Readings</h2>
    <p>This is the first reading of pressures that I took. The van is off. Looks like about 56 psi on the low side, and 77 psi on the high side.</p>

    <h2>Initial Temperature Readings</h2>
    <p>These are the first temperature readings I took, with the van off. All say 82째.</p>

    <img src="img/temp%20reading%20right%201.jpg" alt="Temperature Readings Right 1">

    <h2>Pressure Readings after Running 2 min</h2>
    <p>These are the pressure readings after turning on the van for about a couple minutes. Very marginal jump in the high side. Looks like the high side is now about 82 psi. Don't see any real difference on the low side.</p>

    <h2>Pressure Readings after 10 Minutes</h2>
    <p>After about 10 minutes of running, the low side looks like it's about 58 psi, and the high side looks like it's about 96 psi.</p>

    <h2>Temperature Readings on Vents after 10 Minutes</h2>
    <p>There doesn't appear to be any real difference for temperature on the left vent. The middle vent dropped about 3째 to around 79째. The right vent temperature actually looks like it was first read about 90 degrees and went down to about 74째 or so. So it looks like I got the right vent to barely work some.</p>

    <h2>Pressure Readings after 15 Minutes</h2>
    <p>After stopping the van about five minutes later (so that would be about 15 minutes of run time), the low side is almost 60 psi and the high side is almost 100 psi.</p>

    <h2>Pressure Readings after 40 Minutes</h2>
    <p>About 40 minutes after the van was shut off, the readings have gone down to about 57 psi on the low side, and about 78 psi on the high side.</p>

        Based on these readings and information, I think I'm looking at a bad compressor or possibly a stuck open expansion valve, or possibly a combination of problems. I want to try to isolate the exact problem as much as possible, before just going in and replacing parts. After all, I don't want to pressurize or charge, and then have to reclaim and then recharge and go to that process multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking to do this all myself if possible. I think I would be open to buying a refrigerant recovery machine, and a tank.
        I already have a set of gauges (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00829QKL4?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">MASTERCOOL 98661-PRO Blue R134a</a>) with a couple sets of hoses to read the pressures
        and a vacuum pump (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL3FHY7D?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">SPECSTAR 110V 1/2 HP 5 CFM Dual Stage Rotary Vane HVAC Air Vacuum Pump</a>).
        I've bought three cans of refrigerant to recharge when the time comes.
        I also bought a receiver dryer to replace the presumed used one in the condenser (Four Seasons 83029 A/C Receiver Drier).
        I'm looking at someone selling a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/678456327344731">CPS NTR21 (PRO-SET TR21)</a> for $450. 
        Since these are apparently selling new for around $900, this might be a deal, although I don't know why these would be so expensive compared to others.
        I also see this older charging machine for sale (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/3401541260119847">Viper GT R12 & 134a Automotive AC Charging Machine</a>) 
        that would be rediculous for some resident to buy... However, if it would still be relevant today and it works (and they accept an offer), what would be potential pros and cons?
        Would you be able to tell me the pros and cons of whatever refrigerant recovery machine I might get, including this one to recover R134A?
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing that's been very hard to find is information on what I do with the reclaimed refrigerant once I have it in the tank. 
        Could you offer any advice on how to find someplace local to take the recovered refrigerant once I'm done with it?
    </p>
    <p>
        So, could you please tell me not just what the most likely component is, but an explanation of the whole analyzation of my readings so that I could understand please? 
        I would appreciate that very much. I'm also thinking I could use the refrigerant recovery machine for HVAC work for my house, should the need ever arise. 
        Would that make sense, or perhaps I need to be aware of why that would be such a good idea? It's not like I've had any education in AC systems. 
        I've seen some YouTube videos. They don't explain everything at all. 
        I believe I might do this process for some other cars though, so I think it might be worth getting a refrigerant recovery machine and tank. 
        I'm hoping for some thorough advice regarding this for a layman. Please let me know how I might ask for and pay for this service. Thanks.
